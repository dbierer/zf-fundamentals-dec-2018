## VM NOTES
* from Richard to All Participants:
    * there is a problem that my VM is taking my resource crazily and running really slowly. Do we need to run VM in the class? Or I can just watch the recording later?
    * The thing is it is gradually slowing, might be something running background.
* from Peter to All Participants:
    * Because I had spare memory and CPU on my host, I changed my setting to use 8GB memory and 2 CPUs

## Q & A
* Q: Where do I find examples of ZF tests?
